            Specifies how micro should access the system clipboard. Possible values are:
            external:
              Accesses clipboard via an external tool,
                such as xclip/xsel or wl-clipboard on Linux,
                pbcopy/pbpaste on MacOS,
                and system calls on Windows.
              On Linux,
                if you do not have one of the tools installed or if they are not working,
              micro will throw an error and use an internal clipboard.
            terminal:
              Accesses the clipboard via your terminal emulator.
              Note that there is limited support among terminal emulators for this feature (called OSC 52).
              Terminals that are known to work are
                Kitty (enable reading with clipboard_control setting),
                iTerm2 (only copying),

            micro just uses a boolean modified that is set to true as soon as the user makes an edit.
          This is fast,
            but can be inaccurate.
          If fastdirty is off,
            then micro will hash the current buffer against a hash of the original file (created when the buffer was loaded).
          This is more accurate but obviously more resource intensive.
          This option will be automatically disabled if the file size exceeds 50KB.

            This determines what kind of line endings micro will use for the file.
            Unix line endings are just \n (linefeed) whereas dos line endings are \r\n (carriage return + linefeed).
            The two possible values for this option are "unix" and "dos".
            The fileformat will be automatically detected (when you open an existing file) and displayed on the statusline,
              but this option is useful if you would like to change the line endings or if you are starting a new file.
            Changing this option while editing a file will change its line endings.
            Opening a file with this option set will only have an effect if the file is empty/newly created,

          Enable mouse support.
          When mouse support is disabled,
            usually the terminal will be able to access mouse events,
            which can be useful if you want to copy from the terminal instead of from micro.

          If you are pasting using the terminal keybinding (not Ctrl-v, which is micro's default paste keybinding),
            then it is a good idea to
              enable this option during the paste and

          The column number can also be dropped to open the file at a given line and column 0.
          Note that with this option enabled it is not possible to open a file such as file.txt:10:5,
            where :10:5 is part of the filename.
          It is also possible to open a file with a certain cursor location by using the +LINE,COL flag syntax.

          This option causes backups (see backup option) to be permanently saved.
          With permanent backups,
